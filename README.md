# React-Native


## What is React-Native?
React Native allows you to build mobile apps with JavaScript and React, and is supportable for both android and iOS platforms.  

"The working principles of React Native are basically the same as React except that it is not manipulating the DOM via the VirtualDom but some native views. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serializable, asynchronous and batched Bridge" Wikipedia
